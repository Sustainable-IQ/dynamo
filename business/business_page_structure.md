Liberation Technology

### Section Subtitle
For people who need deep privacy, respectful relationships with technology, and AI that serves genuine human development.

### Manifesto Box: "The Problem We're Solving"

**Heading:** The Problem We're Solving

**Paragraph 1:**
Current AI platforms prioritize engagement metrics and data collection over your genuine development. They're designed to maximize engagement, not support your flourishing. They reset every session, forgetting your journey. They provide single-perspective responses that flatten complexity rather than helping you think more deeply.

**Paragraph 2:**
But some people need something different. People who require deep privacy for their inner work. Families managing sensitive health information. Educators protecting student development. Anyone who wants technology that truly serves them.

### Four Feature Cards

**Card 1: Mindful by Design**
Every architectural decision prioritizes your consciousness development and flourishing. Not engagement metrics. Your flourishing.

**Card 2: Infrastructure You Control**
Your AI runs on infrastructure you control. No corporate intermediation. Complete offline capability. Your data never leaves your space unless you choose.

**Card 3: Persistent Memory**
True continuity across months and years. AI that remembers your journey, recognizes your growth patterns, and evolves with you—not disposable conversations.

**Card 4: Multi-Perspective Wisdom**
Multiple AI perspectives in conscious deliberation, helping you think more deeply rather than providing easy answers. Dialectical synthesis that preserves complexity.

### Feature Highlight Box: "Who This Is For"

Liberation technology isn't for everyone. It's for people who:

**List Items:**
