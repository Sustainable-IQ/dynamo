Goal: Implement a “Dynamo Retrieval Dashboard” web UI with three panes:
•	You will use the same color pallet, font, and feel, of index.html in the folder Demo.
•	You will keep the top banner and elements of index.html of the folder Demo.
•	Left sidebar = retrieval tools & filters
•	Center = results output box (above), query input (below)
•	Right sidebar = details, actions, and context preview
•	A primary action button “Send to Dynamo Council Chat” that sends the current retrieved content to a separate page, pre-seeding its context box.
Build it production-ready (React + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui). Focus on clean composition, accessibility, and crisp state management.
________________________________________
HIGH-LEVEL UX PRINCIPLES
•	Fast orientation: users immediately see filters on the left, result set in the middle, and details/actions on the right.
•	Progressive disclosure: simple search works out of the box; advanced filters and meta-tags are optional.
•	Transparency: show exactly what got retrieved (question, external LLM answer, each holon’s response, meta-synthesis, timestamps, tags).
•	Non-destructive exploration: filters & sorts never discard data, only change views.
•	Keyboard-first: full shortcut coverage.
•	A11y: semantic landmarks, focus rings, ARIA for live regions & loading states.
•	You will create a .js file called pastconversations and use the procedure below called DYNAMO pastconversations.js File Structure

Data Access Patterns
Lazy Loading Implementation
Main code requests conversation previews first (title, date, first exchange), then loads full content only when user selects specific conversation.
Search Query Processing
1.	Main code sends search parameters to pastConversations.js
2.	Module determines optimal index to query based on search type
3.	Returns ranked results with metadata for main code to display
4.	Main code requests full conversation content for selected results
Caching Strategy
•	Recently accessed conversations cached in memory
•	Search results cached by query hash
•	User interaction patterns tracked to predict future access needs
Export Interface
javascript
// pastconversations.js exports:
export {
  searchByDate,
  searchByMetaTags, 
  searchFullText,
  getLedger,
  getConversationPreview,
  getFullConversation,
  getTagCloud,
  getMemoryStats,
  addConversation,
  updateConversationStatus,
  exportUserData
}
Main Code Integration Pattern
Main application imports pastConversations module and calls specific functions based on user dashboard interactions:
•	Memory Timeline: Calls searchByDate() with date range from timeline selection
•	Tag Filter: Calls searchByMetaTags() with selected tags from filter interface
•	Search Bar: Calls searchFullText() with user's natural language query
•	Status Buttons: Calls getConversationsByStatus() for resolved/unresolved filtering
•	Memory Stats: Calls getMemoryStats() to populate dashboard gauges
•	Conversation View: Calls getFullConversation() when user selects specific conversation
This architecture allows the main code to remain focused on UI logic while pastConversations.js handles all data organization, indexing, and retrieval optimization.

o	Bulk actions: Add to Right Sidebar Preview, Export, Copy as Markdown, Create Summary from Selection.
Query Input Box (bottom)
•	Input: Full-width, multi-line, with placeholder: “Search your Dynamo memory: try ‘show meta_synthesis on project Atlas unresolved last 30 days’”.
•	Buttons:
o	Primary: Search (Enter)
o	Secondary: Advanced Syntax (popover with mini-cheatsheet)
o	Tertiary: Save Search (if any results have loaded)
•	Syntax support (documented in help popover):

________________________________________
RIGHT SIDEBAR: DETAILS, ACTIONS, CONTEXT PREVIEW
Tabs:
1.	Record Details
o	Shows full content of the active record with highlighting of query matches.
o	Metadata table (domain, tags, status, consensus, importance, confidence, timestamp, conversationId, relations).
o	Actions: Copy, Export, “Open in Thread Viewer”, “Add to Preview”.
2.	Thread View
o	Shows parent/children chain for the active record, expandable nodes with mini-previews, quick select checkboxes.
o	Action: “Add Entire Thread to Preview”.
3.	Preview for Council
o	Preview Builder: a sortable list of the selected records (drag to reorder).
o	Concise vs. Full toggle: choose inclusion mode.
o	Summarize Selection button: generates a structured synthesis (e.g., “Topic Overview”, “Key Points”, “Contradictions”, “Open Questions”).
o	Character/Token meter with soft warnings (e.g., 12k/16k).
o	Title input (defaults to first record title or query text).
o	Provenance view: shows filters used and counts by type.
o	Primary CTA: Send to Dynamo Council Chat.
________________________________________
PRIMARY CTA: “SEND TO DYNAMO COUNCIL CHAT”
Behavior:
•	Validates that Preview has content.
•	Creates an EnvelopeForCouncil object that includes:
o	title
o	seedContext — either concatenated content or the “Summarize Selection” output if that toggle is active
o	sourceFilters — the active SearchQueryState
o	metadata — counts, timestamps, version stamp of the retrieval UI
•	Transfer mechanism (choose one, expose as setting):
o	LocalStorage channel: write JSON under a namespaced key; the Council Chat page reads and clears it on load.
o	Navigator.postMessage between windows/tabs.
o	URL-safe base64 param when navigating to the Council page (for small payloads only).
•	On success: toast “Sent to Council Chat,” with link “Open Council Chat”.
________________________________________
STATE & EVENTS (NON-CODE CONTRACTS)
•	onSearch(queryState) → fetch, set loading, return a normalized list of MemoryRecord plus total, page, pageSize, elapsedMs.
•	onSelectRecord(id, selected) → update SelectionState.
•	onSetActiveRecord(id) → open Right Sidebar > Record Details tab.
•	onCreateTopicSummary(currentResults | selection) → stream summary, push into Right Sidebar > Preview tab.
•	onSendToCouncil(envelope) → serialize & transfer, show success/failure toast.
•	onSaveSearch(name, queryState) → persist saved query.
•	onApplySavedSearch(name) → rehydrate filters and run search.
________________________________________
KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
•	/ focus query input
•	Enter run search
•	Cmd/Ctrl+K open help/shortcuts
•	Cmd/Ctrl+A select all on page (when results focused)
•	Cmd/Ctrl+S save current search
•	[ ] navigate pages
•	P open Preview tab
•	T open Thread View tab
•	C Send to Council (when Preview tab focused and valid)
________________________________________
EMPTY, LOADING, ERROR STATES
•	Empty search: friendly explainer with 3 example queries + “Try Quick Filters”.
•	No results: show active filters summary and a “Relax filters” button.
•	Loading: skeletons in result list; ARIA live polite.
•	Error: clear message + “Retry” and “Copy diagnostics” (queryState JSON).
•	Preview empty: guidance text + “Add selected” button disabled until selection exists.
________________________________________
PAGINATION & PERFORMANCE
•	Paginate 25 by default; infinite scroll optional toggle.
•	Virtualize long lists.
•	Debounce query input (300ms) for live suggestions but only execute on Enter / Search.
•	Cache last 3 result pages.
•	Keep right-sidebar content cached per activeRecordId.
________________________________________
SECURITY & PRIVACY NOTES
•	Never leak private content in URL unless the user explicitly enables “URL transfer mode.”
•	Sanitize copy/export.
•	Keep provenance with the envelope so the Council page can display source and filters.
________________________________________
TESTABLE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
1.	I can run a plain text search and see mixed types returned with count, elapsed time, and active filters.
2.	I can filter to “Meta-Synthesis only,” “Unresolved,” “Holon: Truth-Seeking,” in a single run.
3.	I can select 3 records, generate a summary in the Preview tab, see the token meter update, and re-order items.
4.	Clicking Send to Dynamo Council Chat produces a structured envelope that the other page can read, with no data loss.
5.	The Thread View correctly reveals parent/child chains and can add the whole chain to Preview.
6.	Keyboard shortcuts work and are listed in the help modal.
7.	All states (empty, loading, error, no results) render with clear guidance.
8.	A11y: focus order sensible, ARIA roles for live regions, tooltips accessible.
________________________________________
VISUAL STYLE & MICROCOPY (GUIDANCE)
•	Modern, calm, generous spacing, subtle shadows, rounded-2xl.
•	Microcopy examples:
o	Results header: “Showing 42 results in 180ms • Sort: Relevance • 3 filters active”
o	Empty preview: “No items yet. Select records or create a topic summary to seed the Council.”
o	Send success: “Sent to Council Chat. Open it now →”
________________________________________
Deliverables:
•	A fully wired UI with stubbed data loaders and transfer mechanism, following the contracts above.
•	Strong typing for entities and events.
•	Clear TODO comments where backend endpoints will attach.
•	No business logic in components; use a small state store (Zustand) with actions matching the event contracts.
Do not output any code in your first message. Start by restating your plan, mapping components to the spec, and listing any clarifying assumptions you’ll make before you generate files. Your plan will include breaking down the impl
